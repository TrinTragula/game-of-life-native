# Conway's game of life

An app to play Conway's game of life, implemented using React Native and Expo.

When I first learn something, I usually start by implementing this game. This time I also decided to publish this repo to honor the memory of its inventor, [John Conway](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Conway), who has recently passed away.

This was not made with performance in mind. Like, at all. I just wanted to see if this could be done only using views (you can, even if at a **huge** performance cost)

## Example
